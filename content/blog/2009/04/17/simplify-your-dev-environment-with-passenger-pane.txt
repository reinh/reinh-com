Passenger Pane is an OS X preference pane designed to work in concert with Phusion Passenger and your default OS X Leopard Apache2 installation. Setup is pretty simple and will probably take about 10 minutes, but there are a few gotchas to avoid. Here's what we're going to do:

1. Install Phusion Passenger

2. Install Passenger Pane

3. Serve a "Hello World!" Rack app

4. Profit!

### Installing Phusion Passenger

Phusion Passenger is the (not so) new hotness in the Rails deployment world. Also, [their website](http://www.modrails.com) looks fantastic. Phusion is great for serving Rails applications via Apache in production (especially in concert with Rails Enterprise Edition, which provides a 33% memory savings over standard MRI Ruby), but it's also great for simplifying your development environment.

The Phusion team have done a great job on the passenger install. Here are the [official installation instructions](http://www.modrails.com/install.html). We'll repeat them here for the sake of convenience.
